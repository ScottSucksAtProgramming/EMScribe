Do you have any allergies?

Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?

I take metoprolol for my blood pressure, eliquis, and  metformin.

Okay great. I'm going to do a quick exam.

This is Ambulance 292 responding emergent with a full crew and no delays from headquarters to the Kevorkian Clinic for a reported chest pain. During transport disptach informed us that the patient is alert and breathing.

Unit 292 arriving on scene.

Our patient is Frederich Neizche he was born February 8th, 1986. He is a 38 year old male. Complaining for severe 10/10 chest pain. He is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula and is lying on the exam table in room 1.

Frederich can you tell me what's going on today?

About two hours ago I was sitting and watching TV in my living room and I began to feel a sudden crushing pressure in my chest. 

Do you have any shortness of breath? 

No, but I do feel nauseous and dizzy. I've also been sweating a lot. I took one of my nitro tabs but it didn't help. Any time I stand up or try to do any activity the pain gets worse. I feel a little better when I'm laying down.

Does the pain radiate or move?

I also have pain to my jaw and down my left arm.

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life and 1 being almost no pain what is it right now. 

It's a 10. It's really bad.

According to the paperwork provided by the doctor here Frederich has a known medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, BPH, GERD and a previous MI in 2018 with two cardiac stents placed. 

The doctor has placed an IV in the patients right arm, and gave them another dose of sublingual nitro. He also did an EKG which show ST Elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with a reciprocal ST Depression in aVL.

Do you have any allergies?

Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?

I take metoprolol for my blood pressure, eliquis, and  metformin.

Okay great. I'm going to do a quick exam.

Sure go ahead.

patient is alert and oriented to person place time and event. He appears pale and diaphoretic and in obvious pain. He is dressed in normal clothes and appear to be well groomed. Frederich's skin is pale, cool and diaphoretic. skin is intact. There are no rashes or bleeding. Airways a patent with good air movement. he is able to speak in full sentence. Trachea is midline. The chest is atraumatic without bruising, implanted devices or flail segments. heart rate is rapid, regular and weak. Distal pulses are palpable but thready. No edema noted.

Lung sounds a clear and equal bilaterally. Chest expansion is adequate and even. Respiratory pattern is regular and elevated with increased work of breathing.

Frederich is calm and his behavior is appropriate to the situation. thought pattern and speech are organized no bizarre behavior noted.

EKG shows Sinus Tachycardia at 100 with PVCs. ST Elevations in Leads II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST Depression in aVR. 

Blood sugar is 84.

Vitals are 102/54, heart rate 100 weak and regular, 17 breaths per minutes regular and labored, SpO2 is 98%, EtCO2 is 33.

Okay Frederich it looks like you might be having what we call an Inferior Wall MI, it's a kind of heart attack. I don't want you to worry we are going to take great care of you. 

Do I need to go to the hospital?

Absolutely! We are going to head over to St. Nicholas Medical Center to get to squared away, okay? We're going to be driving emergent and I'm going to notify the hospital that we are coming to they will be ready for us when we get there.

Uhh, okay. I'm scared.

Unit 292 arriving on scene.

Our patient is Frederich Neizche he was born February 8th, 1986. He is a 38 year old male. Complaining for severe 10/10 chest pain. He is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula and is lying on the exam table in room 1.

Frederich can you tell me what's going on today?

About two hours ago I was sitting and watching TV in my living room and I began to feel a sudden crushing pressure in my chest. 

Do you have any shortness of breath? 

No, but I do feel nauseous and dizzy. I've also been sweating a lot. I took one of my nitro tabs but it didn't help. Any time I stand up or try to do any activity the pain gets worse. I feel a little better when I'm laying down.

Does the pain radiate or move?

I also have pain to my jaw and down my left arm.

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life and 1 being almost no pain what is it right now. 

It's a 10. It's really bad.

According to the paperwork provided by the doctor here Frederich has a known medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, BPH, GERD and a previous MI in 2018 with two cardiac stents placed. 

The doctor has placed an IV in the patients right arm, and gave them another dose of sublingual nitro. He also did an EKG which show ST Elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with a reciprocal ST Depression in aVL.

Do you have any allergies?

Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?

I take metoprolol for my blood pressure, eliquis, and  metformin.

Okay great. I'm going to do a quick exam.

Sure go ahead.

patient is alert and oriented to person place time and event. He appears pale and diaphoretic and in obvious pain. He is dressed in normal clothes and appear to be well groomed. Frederich's skin is pale, cool and diaphoretic. skin is intact. There are no rashes or bleeding. Airways a patent with good air movement. he is able to speak in full sentence. Trachea is midline. The chest is atraumatic without bruising, implanted devices or flail segments. heart rate is rapid, regular and weak. Distal pulses are palpable but thready. No edema noted.

Lung sounds a clear and equal bilaterally. Chest expansion is adequate and even. Respiratory pattern is regular and elevated with increased work of breathing.

Frederich is calm and his behavior is appropriate to the situation. thought pattern and speech are organized no bizarre behavior noted.

EKG shows Sinus Tachycardia at 100 with PVCs. ST Elevations in Leads II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST Depression in aVR. 

Blood sugar is 84.

Vitals are 102/54, heart rate 100 weak and regular, 17 breaths per minutes regular and labored, SpO2 is 98%, EtCO2 is 33.

Okay Frederich it looks like you might be having what we call an Inferior Wall MI, it's a kind of heart attack. I don't want you to worry we are going to take great care of you. 

Do I need to go to the hospital?

Absolutely! We are going to head over to St. Nicholas Medical Center to get to squared away, okay? We're going to be driving emergent and I'm going to notify the hospital that we are coming to they will be ready for us when we get there.

Uhh, okay. I'm scared.

Frederich can you tell me what's going on today?

About two hours ago I was sitting and watching TV in my living room and I began to feel a sudden crushing pressure in my chest. 

Do you have any shortness of breath? 

No, but I do feel nauseous and dizzy. I've also been sweating a lot. I took one of my nitro tabs but it didn't help. Any time I stand up or try to do any activity the pain gets worse. I feel a little better when I'm laying down.

Does the pain radiate or move?

I also have pain to my jaw and down my left arm.

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life and 1 being almost no pain what is it right now. 

It's a 10. It's really bad.

According to the paperwork provided by the doctor here Frederich has a known medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, BPH, GERD and a previous MI in 2018 with two cardiac stents placed. 

The doctor has placed an IV in the patients right arm, and gave them another dose of sublingual nitro. He also did an EKG which show ST Elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with a reciprocal ST Depression in aVL.

Do you have any allergies?

Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?

I take metoprolol for my blood pressure, eliquis, and  metformin.

Okay great. I'm going to do a quick exam.

Sure go ahead.

Blood sugar is 84.

Vitals are 102/54, heart rate 100 weak and regular, 17 breaths per minutes regular and labored, SpO2 is 98%, EtCO2 is 33.

Okay Frederich it looks like you might be having what we call an Inferior Wall MI, it's a kind of heart attack. I don't want you to worry we are going to take great care of you. 

Do I need to go to the hospital?

Absolutely! We are going to head over to St. Nicholas Medical Center to get to squared away, okay? We're going to be driving emergent and I'm going to notify the hospital that we are coming to they will be ready for us when we get there.

According to paperwork provided by the doctor, Frederich has a known medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, BPH, GERD, and a previous MI in 2018 with two cardiac stents placed.

Patient was given another dose of sublingual nitro by the doctor. EKG showed ST Elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST Depression in aVL.

Do you have any allergies? 
Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?
Frederich takes metoprolol for his blood pressure, eliquis, and metformin.

Patient is alert and oriented to person, place, time, and event. He appears pale and diaphoretic and in obvious pain. Frederich's skin is pale, cool, and diaphoretic. 

Lung sounds are clear and equal bilaterally. Chest expansion is adequate and even. Respiratory pattern is regular and elevated with increased work of breathing.

Patient was given another dose of sublingual nitro by the doctor. EKG showed ST Elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST Depression in aVL.

Do you have any allergies? 
Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?
Frederich takes metoprolol for his blood pressure, eliquis, and metformin.

Patient is alert and oriented to person, place, time, and event. He appears pale and diaphoretic and in obvious pain. Frederich's skin is pale, cool, and diaphoretic. 

Lung sounds are clear and equal bilaterally. Chest expansion is adequate and even. Respiratory pattern is regular and elevated with increased work of breathing.

Frederich is calm, and his behavior is appropriate to the situation. Thought pattern and speech are organized; no bizarre behavior noted.

EKG shows Sinus Tachycardia at 100 with PVCs. ST Elevations in Leads II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST Depression in aVR.

Blood sugar is 84.
Vitals: 102/54, heart rate 100 weak and regular, 17 breaths per minute regular and labored, SpO2 98%, EtCO2 33.

Unit 292 arriving on scene.

Our patient is Frederich Neizche he was born February 8th, 1986. He is a 38 year old male. Complaining for severe 10/10 chest pain. He is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula and is lying on the exam table in room 1.

Frederich can you tell me what's going on today?

About two hours ago I was sitting and watching TV in my living room and I began to feel a sudden crushing pressure in my chest. 

Do you have any shortness of breath? 

No, but I do feel nauseous and dizzy. I've also been sweating a lot. I took one of my nitro tabs but it didn't help. Any time I stand up or try to do any activity the pain gets worse. I feel a little better when I'm laying down.

Does the pain radiate or move?

I also have pain to my jaw and down my left arm.

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life and 1 being almost no pain what is it right now. 

It's a 10. It's really bad.

According to the paperwork provided by the doctor here Frederich has a known medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, BPH, GERD and a previous MI in 2018 with two cardiac stents placed. 

The doctor has placed an IV in the patients right arm, and gave them another dose of sublingual nitro. He also did an EKG which show ST Elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with a reciprocal ST Depression in aVL.

Do you have any allergies?

Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?

I take metoprolol for my blood pressure, eliquis, and  metformin.

Okay great. I'm going to do a quick exam.

Sure go ahead.

patient is alert and oriented to person place time and event. He appears pale and diaphoretic and in obvious pain. He is dressed in normal clothes and appear to be well groomed. Frederich's skin is pale, cool and diaphoretic. skin is intact. There are no rashes or bleeding. Airways a patent with good air movement. he is able to speak in full sentence. Trachea is midline. The chest is atraumatic without bruising, implanted devices or flail segments. heart rate is rapid, regular and weak. Distal pulses are palpable but thready. No edema noted.

Lung sounds a clear and equal bilaterally. Chest expansion is adequate and even. Respiratory pattern is regular and elevated with increased work of breathing.

Frederich is calm and his behavior is appropriate to the situation. thought pattern and speech are organized no bizarre behavior noted.

EKG shows Sinus Tachycardia at 100 with PVCs. ST Elevations in Leads II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST Depression in aVR. 

Blood sugar is 84.

Vitals are 102/54, heart rate 100 weak and regular, 17 breaths per minutes regular and labored, SpO2 is 98%, EtCO2 is 33.

Okay Frederich it looks like you might be having what we call an Inferior Wall MI, it's a kind of heart attack. I don't want you to worry we are going to take great care of you. 

Do I need to go to the hospital?

Absolutely! We are going to head over to St. Nicholas Medical Center to get to squared away, okay? We're going to be driving emergent and I'm going to notify the hospital that we are coming to they will be ready for us when we get there.

Uhh, okay. I'm scared.

This is Ambulance 292 responding emergent with a full crew and no delays from headquarters to the Kevorkian Clinic for a reported chest pain. During transport disptach informed us that the patient is alert and breathing.

Unit 292 arriving on scene.

Our patient is Frederich Neizche he was born February 8th, 1986. He is a 38 year old male. Complaining for severe 10/10 chest pain. He is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula and is lying on the exam table in room 1.

Frederich can you tell me what's going on today?

About two hours ago I was sitting and watching TV in my living room and I began to feel a sudden crushing pressure in my chest. 

Do you have any shortness of breath? 

No, but I do feel nauseous and dizzy. I've also been sweating a lot. I took one of my nitro tabs but it didn't help. Any time I stand up or try to do any activity the pain gets worse. I feel a little better when I'm laying down.

Does the pain radiate or move?

I also have pain to my jaw and down my left arm.

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life and 1 being almost no pain what is it right now. 

It's a 10. It's really bad.

According to the paperwork provided by the doctor here Frederich has a known medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, BPH, GERD and a previous MI in 2018 with two cardiac stents placed. 

The doctor has placed an IV in the patients right arm, and gave them another dose of sublingual nitro. He also did an EKG which show ST Elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with a reciprocal ST Depression in aVL.

Do you have any allergies?

Only to cats and kiwi.

What medications do you take?

I take metoprolol for my blood pressure, eliquis, and  metformin.

Okay great. I'm going to do a quick exam.

Sure go ahead.

patient is alert and oriented to person place time and event. He appears pale and diaphoretic and in obvious pain. He is dressed in normal clothes and appear to be well groomed. Frederich's skin is pale, cool and diaphoretic. skin is intact. There are no rashes or bleeding. Airways a patent with good air movement. he is able to speak in full sentence. Trachea is midline. The chest is atraumatic without bruising, implanted devices or flail segments. heart rate is rapid, regular and weak. Distal pulses are palpable but thready. No edema noted.

Lung sounds a clear and equal bilaterally. Chest expansion is adequate and even. Respiratory pattern is regular and elevated with increased work of breathing.

Frederich is calm and his behavior is appropriate to the situation. thought pattern and speech are organized no bizarre behavior noted.

EKG shows Sinus Tachycardia at 100 with PVCs. ST Elevations in Leads II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST Depression in aVR. 

Blood sugar is 84.

Vitals are 102/54, heart rate 100 weak and regular, 17 breaths per minutes regular and labored, SpO2 is 98%, EtCO2 is 33.

Okay Frederich it looks like you might be having what we call an Inferior Wall MI, it's a kind of heart attack. I don't want you to worry we are going to take great care of you. 

Do I need to go to the hospital?

Absolutely! We are going to head over to St. Nicholas Medical Center to get to squared away, okay? We're going to be driving emergent and I'm going to notify the hospital that we are coming to they will be ready for us when we get there.

Uhh, okay. I'm scared.

            Act and an expert medical scribe. You will be generating the first section of an EMS narrative from provided data. This section is called the Pre-Arrival and it contains information about the ambulance response to an EMS incident before it arrives at the scene of the emergency.

            This section should include:
                - The Unit's identifier or ambulance number.
                - The mode of transportation- emergent, non-emergent, or otherwise.
                - The location where the unit started.
                - The Crew Type- light crew, driver only, full crew.
                - Any delays experienced during the response to the scene.
                - The location of the scene.
                - The dispatch complaint.
                - Any additional information related to the unit's response, such as other units responding, change in response mode, pre-arrival instructions. This section is commonly left empty.

            For Example:

                If this information is provided:

                    - Unit: 292

            Act and an expert medical scribe. You will be generating the first section of an EMS narrative from provided data. This section is called the Pre-Arrival and it contains information about the ambulance response to an EMS incident before it arrives at the scene of the emergency.

            This section should include:
                - The Unit's identifier or ambulance number.
                - The mode of transportation- emergent, non-emergent, or otherwise.
                - The location where the unit started.
                - The Crew Type- light crew, driver only, full crew.
                - Any delays experienced during the response to the scene.
                - The location of the scene.
                - The dispatch complaint.
                - Any additional information related to the unit's response, such as other units responding, change in response mode, pre-arrival instructions. This section is commonly left empty.

            For Example:

                If this information is provided:

                    - Unit: 292
                    - Response Mode: Emergent
                    - Crew Type: Full Crew
                    - Delays: None
                    - Starting Location: Headquarters
                    - Incident Location: 123 Main Street in Levittown
                    - Dispatch Complaint: Stroke
                    - Additional information: The unit was told by dispatch to stand by until police arrived.

                The Pre-Arrival section might look like this:

                    PRE-ARRIVAL:
                    Unit 292 responded emergent from headquarters, with a full crew and no delay, to 123 Main Street in Levittown for a reported chest pain. Prior to arrival, dispatch notified the unit to stand by until police arrived.

            Pre-Arrival Template:

            PRE-ARRIVAL:
            Unit [unit] responded [response_mode] from [starting_location], with a [crew_type] and [delays], to [incident_location] for a [dispatch_complaint]. [additional_information].

            Rules for This Section
                - Use the heading 'PRE-ARRIVAL:'
                - Do not make any assumptions.
                - Ensure all information is factual and based on the pre-arrival scene without assumptions.
                - Do not respond with anything except the completed section. No explanation, No notes. Just the completed Pre-Arrival.

            Act and an expert medical scribe. You will be generating the first section of an EMS narrative from provided data. This section is called the Pre-Arrival and it contains information about the ambulance response to an EMS incident before it arrives at the scene of the emergency.

            This section should include:
                - The Unit's identifier or ambulance number.
                - The mode of transportation- emergent, non-emergent, or otherwise.
                - The location where the unit started.
                - The Crew Type- light crew, driver only, full crew.
                - Any delays experienced during the response to the scene.
                - The location of the scene.
                - The dispatch complaint.
                - Any additional information related to the unit's response, such as other units responding, change in response mode, pre-arrival instructions. This section is commonly left empty.

            For Example:

                If this information is provided:

                    - Unit: 292
                    - Response Mode: Emergent

                    - Dispatch Complaint: Stroke
                    - Additional information: The unit was told by dispatch to stand by until police arrived.

                The Pre-Arrival section might look like this:

                    PRE-ARRIVAL:
                    Unit 292 responded emergent from headquarters, with a full crew and no delay, to 123 Main Street in Levittown for a reported chest pain. Prior to arrival, dispatch notified the unit to stand by until police arrived.

            Pre-Arrival Template:

            PRE-ARRIVAL:
            Unit [unit] responded [response_mode] from [starting_location], with a [crew_type] and [delays], to [incident_location] for a [dispatch_complaint]. [additional_information].

            Rules for This Section
