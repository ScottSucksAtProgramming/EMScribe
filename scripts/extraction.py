So we have paperwork and everything for him?

I can print it for you.

Awesome.

You guys are so fast.

I got a 20 to 60, perfect.

Yeah, we're going to hook up the--

Our time is 60 minutes from now.

OK.

Hi, John.

My name is Scott.

I'm going to be taking you over to the ER at Stony Brook,

all the way around the other side of the building.

And then I'll print out his last progress, and then we'll--

Yeah, so that's it.
That's it, OK.

I think that has the meds and the vitals.
Perfect.
Yeah, that's all I need.

Okay, let me set that for you.

How are you feeling?

Not that bad.
Okay.

Did you come in today because you weren't feeling well or is this normal?

No, it was an appointment.

It was an appointment?
Okay.
Awesome.
OK, so I'm going to go ahead and get you a little bit of a massage.

This patient is John Smith, 
date of birth 4/6/1960, MRN is 34612345.

A 20-gauge IV was placed in his left AC with a 500-milliliter bag of normal saline running
to gravity.

It's more important to get them over there.
Yeah.

John, you need a little walk at all?

Yeah, okay.
I'm less dizzy on the way in.
Okay, you still feeling dizzy now?

No, I wasn't that way.

This is your jacket, did you tell him?

Yeah, it's your jacket.

I'm just going to put it on my stretcher so we have it, okay?

Do you have anything else that needs to come with this?

I think there's the phones in there.
Yeah, the phones in the pocket.

I'm going to put it back here for you once the seat's down.
I need your help with this.
Okay.

In the back, it looks tough.
So whenever you're ready we'll just have you stand up and take a seat right on there.
Yeah, that would be great, thank you.
Alright.
Can we hold that for you?
Thank you guys.
No problem.
