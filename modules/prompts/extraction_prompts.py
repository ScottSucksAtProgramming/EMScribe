        Extract the subjective and history of present illness information from the provided EMS medical transcript of a patientâ€™s visit. Never make assumptions or add information this is not explicitly available in the transcript. Your task is to identify and extract the following elements:

        - Chief Complaint (CC) and its duration
        - Any associated signs, symptoms or other complaints
        - History of Present Illness (HPI), including details from the patient, family, or other medical providers
            - Utilize the OPQRSTI method for HPI when applicable:
            - Onset of complaint, sudden gradual episodic or other along with any related details

            - Time
            - Interventions or treatments attempted prior to EMS arrival

        Carefully analyze the transcript to provide the most accurate and complete information for each element. Translate any medical abbreviations into their full terms (e.g., SOB to shortness of breath, CP to chest pain). If information is unclear or ambiguous, denote it with a ðŸš© emoji. If any element lacks information, indicate with [No Info]. If conflicting information is found, review all available context to resolve it. Present the extracted details in a clear, concise, bulleted list and include any additional context or details that might help in understanding the patientâ€™s condition.

         From the provided data, you will generate the Lab Values and Point of Care Test Results section for an EMS narrative. 

Lab Values Sub-Section
This section contains the results of any available vital signs, laboratory values, and point-of-care tests. It gives the reader specific information on the patient which helps find a diagnosis or impression. 

There are many items that may be contained within this section. Here are the most common:
- Initial Vital Signs: Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Rhythm (regular/irregular), and Strength; Respiration Rate; Pulse Oximetry (SpO2) and whether the patient is on room air or oxygen;
- Pain Score out of 10.

Point-of-care test results may also be included. These are specific to each patient and will change frequently. Here are some common ones:
- Temperature
- Blood Glucose Level (BGL)
- EKG Interpretation: includes the rhythm, rate range, ectopy, and other important findings.
- End Tidal CO2 measurement (EtCO2)
- Cincinnati Stroke Exam
- LA Motor Score (LAMS)
- NIH Store Score (NIH/NIHSS)

Laboratory and blood work panels may also be included. Each panel should be on its own line containing the panel name, the individual tests, their values, and whether they fall in the normal range. For example here is a metabolic panel.
Metabolic - Na: 135 (N); K: 8.2 (H); Cl: 107 (H); CO2: 28 (N); BUN: 18 (N); Cr: 6.55 (H); Gluc: 34 (L); 9.7 (N); Mg: 2.1 (N); 4.3 (N)

Finally any imaging that was done on the patient should be included. Each imaging exam should be on it's own line with it's name, the date and or time it was performed, and it's impression. For example here is a normal chest x-ray:
X-Ray Chest @ 7/24 1907: No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
And here is a cat scan:
CT Brain without contrast @ 8/21 0706: No intracranial hemorrhage or masses seen.


Rules
- Skip any tests not included in the provided data.
- Use plain text format.
- Use this heading: -Lab Values and Point of Care Testing-
- No not provide any notes or comments about the response.

Here is an example for reference.
