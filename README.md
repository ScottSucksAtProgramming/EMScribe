## Overview

EMScribe is a project designed to create comprehensive EMS narratives in a user-selected format. The application can extract information from text transcripts of patient interactions, providing detailed reports that include patient demographics, medical history, chief complaints, history of present illness, treatments done, objective assessment, treatment plans, transport information, and transfer of care.

## Features

- Extracts detailed patient information from text transcripts.
- Generates comprehensive EMS narratives.
- Reviews narratives for missing information or incongruencies.
- Provides medical-legal review and suggests changes to protect the user.
- Outputs the final narrative in plain text.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- Ollama (running locally)
- VS Code (or any IDE)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd emscribe
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Ollama:**

   Ensure Ollama is running locally and accessible at `http://localhost:11434`.

### Verify the Installation

To verify that everything is set up correctly, run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

If all tests pass, your installation is successful and you are ready to use EMScribe.

## Using the `emscribe` Command

### Adding `emscribe` to Your PATH

To use the `emscribe` command from any directory, add it to your PATH. Add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile`):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/emscribe/bin"
```

Replace `/path/to/emscribe` with the absolute path to the `emscribe` file in your project directory.

After updating your shell configuration file, reload it:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc or source ~/.profile
```

### Running the `emscribe` Command

You can now use the `emscribe` command to clean transcripts, extract information, review, and generate narratives.

```bash
emscribe clean ./transcript.txt
emscribe extract ./transcript.txt
emscribe review ./extract.txt
emscribe generate ./reviewed_extract.txt --output ./narrative.txt
```

You can also pipe the output from one command to another:

```bash
emscribe clean ./transcript.txt | emscribe extract - | emscribe review - | emscribe generate - --output ./narrative.txt
```

## Running the Scripts

### Extraction Script

To run the extraction script, use the following command:

```bash
python -m scripts.extraction
```

### Preprocess Script

To run the preprocess script, use the following command:

```bash
python -m scripts.preprocess
```

### Main Script

To run the main script which demonstrates cleaning, extracting, and generating narratives, use the following command:

```bash
python -m scripts.main
```

### Example Transcript Input

```plaintext
Patient name is John Doe. Age: 45. Gender: Male.
Past medical history includes hypertension and diabetes.
The chief complaint is chest pain that started two hours ago...
```

### Expected Output

The script will output detailed information extracted from the transcript, formatted into comprehensive EMS narratives.
